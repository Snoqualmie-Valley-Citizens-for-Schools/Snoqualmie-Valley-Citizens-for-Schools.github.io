With significant regrets, Snoqualmie Valley School District (SVSD) has put their reopening plans on hold due to a surge in COVID-19 infections within our community. SVSD will re-evaluate the situation every Wednesday when new King County infection data are released.

For the full text of Superintendent Robert Manahan's letter, please visit the [SVSD website](https://www.svsd410.org/site/Default.aspx?PageType=3&DomainID=4&PageID=1&ViewID=6446ee88-d30c-497e-9316-3f8874b3e108&FlexDataID=26957).
