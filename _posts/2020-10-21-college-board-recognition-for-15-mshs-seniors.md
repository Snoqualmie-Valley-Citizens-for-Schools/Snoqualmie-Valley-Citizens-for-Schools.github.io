Congratulations to Mount Si High School Seniors Aileen Cha, Anika Cusimano, Logan Garwood, Aahir Ghosh, Sam Huseman, Kate Johnson, William Kim, Turner McCutchan, Sullivan McLaughlin, Dylan Scott, Raymond Silverman, Tara Sreekumar, Emma Tuttle, Owen Walker, and Malakhi Wheton! All were recognized by the College Board as National Recognition Program Scholars. All received National Rural and Small Town Recognition. Kate Johnson, Dylan Scott, and Raymond Silverman also received National Hispanic Program Recognition.

The College Board National Recognition Programs recognize students with a 3.5 GPA from underrepresented communities who scored in the top 2.5% of PSAT/NMSQT test takers from a rural area or small town or identify as African American, Hispanic American or Latinx, or Indigenous.

Our district hosts college-prep exams for Mount Si High School and Two Rivers Big Picture High School students, paid for by the district, and administered during school hours. College-prep exams are not part of state basic education and are paid for by local levies.
