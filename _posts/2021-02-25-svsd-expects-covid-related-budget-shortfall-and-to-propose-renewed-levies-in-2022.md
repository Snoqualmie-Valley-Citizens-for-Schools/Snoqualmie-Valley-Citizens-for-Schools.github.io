In the February 25 school board meeting, Assistant Superintendent Ryan Stokes reviewed Snoqualmie Valley School District (SVSD) finances with the school board. The State apportions revenue to districts based upon the number of full time equivalent students. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, attendance is down, thus revenue is also down. At the same time, expenditures are up due to COVID-19-related conditions. To make up the shortfall, the district expects to draw $2.3 million from its reserve fund. However the budget trend is improving. Both State and Federal COVID-relief programs may provide additional revenue to replenish reserves.

Stokes also provided a detailed review of planned expenditures remaining on the $19 million 2018 Technology levy, which expires in 2022. SVSDâ€™s $62 million Education Program and Operations levy also expires in 2022.

SVSD expects to put new levy proposals up for elections ballots in 2022.

A 170 minute audio recording of the school board meeting is available from the [SVSD website](https://www.svsd410.org/cms/lib/WA01919490/Centricity/Domain/74/SVSB2-25-2021Final.mp3).
