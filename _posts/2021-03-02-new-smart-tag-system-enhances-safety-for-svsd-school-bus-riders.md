Snoqualmie Valley School District launched SMART Tag, a new bus safety and security system. SMART Tag monitors the location of school buses, tracks student loading and unloading, and provides real-time location to staff and parents. SMART Tag ensures students board the right bus and exit at their stop.

SMART Tag is not part of state basic education. SVSD launched SMART Tag with transportation funds and may maintain it through a future local technology levy.
