On March 31, the Snoqualmie Valley School District Board of Directors extended an offer to Dr. Lance Gibbon for the open superintendent position. Assuming Dr. Gibbon accepts the position, he brings 29 years of public education experience to the role. Dr. Gibbon previously served in Lake Washington, Anacortes, and Oak Harbor school districts as superintendent, assistant superintendent, elementary principal, assistant principal, professional developer for technology, and elementary music teacher.

Dr. Gibbon spent the last 8 years as superintendent of [Oak Harbor Public Schools](https://www.ohsd.net/). Oak Harbor Public Schools is comparable in size to the Snoqualmie Valley School District. Oak Harbor residents describe Dr. Gibbon as "[ever-present](https://www.whidbeynewstimes.com/news/superintendent-gets-glowing-review-3-3-percent-raise/)" within the schools, engaged in the broader community, goal-oriented in his leadership style, consistent with his follow-through, committed, and "[playful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYAma-trtU4)".

Dr. Lance Gibbon will be the third Snoqualmie Valley superintendent in 3 years following the [unexpected retirement of Dr. Rob Manahan](https://www.valleyrecord.com/news/svsd-superintendent-manahan-will-retire-at-end-of-school-year/) at the end of this school year. Dr. Gibbon will start July 1 at a challenging time for the school district:

* The coronavirus pandemic closed most in-person education for over a year.
* Although [Snoqualmie Valley was one of the fastest districts in King County to resume in-person instruction](/posts/svsd-progress-reopening/), many parents are dissatisfied with the pace of reopening.
* Students struggle with isolation from their peers during remote learning and socially distanced in-person learning.
* District finances have been stretched by reduced enrollment and increased costs, requiring the district to tap into its financial reserves.
* Staff are exhausted from the unrelenting challenges of developing, rolling out, and supporting remote and hybrid educational models.
* Administrators are demoralized by another superintendent transition.
* The district has struggled to maintain reliable bus transportation as the chronic shortage of bus drivers has become critical during the pandemic.
* Reduced substitute teacher availability has resulted in district administrators substituting for ill teachers recovering from COVID vaccinations.
* Despite following health department guidance, the [Mount Si High School football team experienced a coronavirus outbreak](/posts/covid-outbreak-at-football-game-ends-season/) that sicked five and prematurely ended their season.

Collectively, the Snoqualmie Valley School District community is making the best of a very challenging situation, but the stresses and challenges are exhausting. Dr. Gibbon will play a critical role in leading the transition of the Snoqualmie Valley School District community out of this challenging phase and back to its strong performance prior to the pandemic. In February 2022, Snoqualmie Valley residents will vote to renew critical local levies to fund district operations. Dr. Gibbon led Oak Harbor School District to the successful passage of their [replacement levies](https://www.ohsd.net/levy) in February with [55% of the vote](https://www.whidbeynewstimes.com/news/oak-harbor-schools-levy-passing-in-first-vote-counts/).
