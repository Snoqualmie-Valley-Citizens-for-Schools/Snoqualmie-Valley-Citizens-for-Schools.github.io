Congratulations to three Snoqualmie Valley School District students for their acceptance into the 2021 Washington Music Educators Association (WMEA) Junior All-State Honor Choirs!

Mackenzie Colak is a 5th grader at Fall City Elementary School. He was accepted to the WMEA 2021 Junior All-State Youth Choir as an alto. Dallen Jensen is an 8th grader at Twin Falls Middle School. He was accepted to the WMEA 2021 Junior All-State Mixed Choir as an alto. Anna Rose is a 6th grader at Twin Falls Middle School. She was accepted to the WMEA 2021 Junior All-State Youth Choir as a soprano.

Music is not part of state basic education and is funded by local levies and fees.
