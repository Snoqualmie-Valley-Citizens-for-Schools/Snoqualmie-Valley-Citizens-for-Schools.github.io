We want kids back in school when it is safe. However, COVID-19 infection rates remain high in our community, especially amongst school-aged children. Please keep yourself and others healthy by maintaining six feet of physical distancing, minimizing contact with others outside of your home, wash your hands frequently, use a mask, and avoid poorly ventilated rooms.
