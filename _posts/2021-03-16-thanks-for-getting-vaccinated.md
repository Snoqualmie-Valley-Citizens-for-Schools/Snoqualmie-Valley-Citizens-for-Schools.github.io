Locally we've moved to the [deceleration interval](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/national-strategy/intervals-framework.html) of the COVID-19 pandemic because of your efforts. Thank you! According to the [King County Department of Health](https://kingcounty.gov/depts/health/covid-19/data/vaccination.aspx), our region of East King County has the highest vaccination rates for the most vulnerable populations outside of Vashon Island; 94.4% of 65 and older and 100%+ of 75 and older people have at least one dose. When it is your turn, please consider getting vaccinated to protect yourself and those around you. Please continue to social distance and wear your masks until then. Once you're vaccinated, [some of the guidance on gathering start to lighten up](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html).

More immunity will continue to preserve our lower COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths and puts us in a stronger position for more in-person instruction in schools. Your efforts let our schools get back to more in-person instruction.
