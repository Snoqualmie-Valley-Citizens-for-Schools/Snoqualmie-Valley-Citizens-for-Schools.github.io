Snoqualmie Valley School District (SVSD) remains one of the fastest school districts to return to in-person attendance amongst the 18 King County school districts.

Thank you to everybody at the SVSD for working hard and quickly to ensure a safe reopening, while continuing to provide options for students that choose not to attend in person.

For all of the reopening data, visit the [Washington Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) website](https://www.k12.wa.us/about-ospi/press-releases/novel-coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-resources/school-reopening-data).
