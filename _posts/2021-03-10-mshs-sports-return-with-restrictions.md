The Snoqualmie Valley Record featured an [article](https://www.valleyrecord.com/sports/mount-si-high-school-sports-return-with-conditions/) about the return of Mount Si High School sports. Athletic events have a group size limit of 200, or 25% of facility capacity, whichever is lower. The article details how that limit is being enforced and how sports and activities can be streamed on NFHS Network for free.

Sports and activities are not part of state basic education and are paid for by local levies.
