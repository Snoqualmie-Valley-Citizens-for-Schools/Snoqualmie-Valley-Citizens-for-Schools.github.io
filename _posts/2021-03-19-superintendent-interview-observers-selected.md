On March 11, the Snoqualmie Valley Board of Directors drew five observers and two alternates from a hat to observe superintendent candidate interviews March 23 and 25. These observers will be joined by teacher, secretary, bus driver, principal, assistant superintendent, student, and PTSA observers as school board members interview candidates.
