Five participants in the March 20 Mount Si High School football game tested positive for COVID-19. To reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19 further and putting in-person school further at risk, football players, staff, and coaches will self-quarantine. Students will continue their studies by attending school remotely. Unfortunately, this outbreak ends the  season for Mount Si High School varsity and junior varsity football teams.

[Snoqualmie Valley School District's COVID dashboard](https://www.svsd410.org/Page/9259) reports 10 confirmed COVID-19 cases within the last 14 days.
