Congratulations to Mount Si High School Seniors Raymond Silverman, Anika Cusimano, Samuel Husemann, Austin Kinsella-Johnson, Jacob Marzetti, Sullivan McLaughlin, Emma Tuttle, Malakhi Wheaton for earning National Merit Scholars recognition this year. They did so by earning top scores in the 2019 Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test (PSAT/NMSQTÂ®), which students take their junior year.

Raymond Silverman was also named a National Merit Semifinalist because he scored in the top 1% of students nationally. As a semifinalist, Raymond can compete through an application process to be selected as a National Merit Finalist and qualify for college scholarships.

Our district hosts college-prep exams for Mount Si High School and Two Rivers Big Picture High School students, paid for by the district, and administered during school hours. College-prep exams are not part of state basic education and are paid for by local levies.

For more on this recognition and how the district plans to manage testing during COVID-19, please visit the [SVSD website](https://www.svsd410.org/site/Default.aspx?PageType=3&DomainID=4&PageID=1&ViewID=6446ee88-d30c-497e-9316-3f8874b3e108&FlexDataID=26957).
