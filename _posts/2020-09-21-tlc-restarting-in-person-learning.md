Snoqualmie Valley School District began in-person services at the [Transition Learning Center (TLC)](https://www.svsd410.org/Page/643) on September 21, with outdoor pods. On October 19, TLC is moving indoors for in-person instruction!

TLC is not fully funded as part of state basic education and is partially paid for by local levies.
