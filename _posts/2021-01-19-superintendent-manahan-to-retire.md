Snoqualmie Valley School District Superintendent Robert W. Manahan will retire at the end of this 2020-21 school year. His letter to the community follows:

> January 14, 2021
> 
> Dear Snoqualmie Valley families, 
> 
> It has been a tremendous honor to serve the students, staff and families of Snoqualmie Valley for the past three years. After 37 years in public education, I have made the difficult decision to retire at the end of this school year. This decision is coming earlier than planned, and with mixed feelings. It is prompted in part by a health “reality check” that we sometimes face, which calls for reflecting on life goals. For me, I believe this July will be the right to make my transition into retirement and spend more time with my family.
> 
> Throughout my career, I have been surrounded by incredible and inspiring education professionals. Not only teachers, but all those who serve in our school districts to support the academic, social, physical, and emotional growth and well-being of the students and families we serve. In just three years at SVSD, I have seen our staff give extraordinary effort, time and energy to better the lives of our students. This includes our secretaries, bus drivers, mechanics, custodians, paraeducators, food service staff, maintenance and operations crew, and technology professionals. Going beyond the call of duty does not begin to describe the work of our teachers and staff within this district. I often state that their jobs are to change the world and create miracles every day. Indeed, they have, and they do.
> 
> I also want to convey how much I appreciate this community, whose support has meant the world to me. I was accepted with open arms from my first day in this community. My wife, family and I have enjoyed every minute here discovering this region and this community that is so friendly and passionate about education, creating a community that cares for one another. Thank you so much for welcoming my family and I. Remember, great communities make great schools, and great schools make great communities. You have an exceptional community here in the Valley and an exceptional school district. While these times are particularly challenging, I know that together, with the support and collaboration of one another, you will make it through to the other side -- stronger, more resilient and even more focused on meeting the needs of all students in the Valley.
> 
> During my time serving Snoqualmie Valley schools I’ve had the privilege of celebrating some historic accomplishments and tackled some unprecedented challenges. As I look back, opening the amazing new Mount Si High School campus will always be a highlight and source of great pride, knowing the positive impact this will have on SVSD students for years to come. To help equip students for life after graduation, I so appreciated the staff/student/community collaboration that helped to define Snoqualmie Valley’s Portrait of a Graduate goals, prioritizing the key characteristics we are working to instill in every graduate to help them find success and satisfaction in life and the career path they choose.
> 
> More recently, I am proud of the work that has begun to increase community discussions around Diversity Equity and Inclusion practices and provide staff training focused on ensuring we serve and support EVERY student well.  And, while the COVID pandemic has certainly challenged us in ways we never could a have predicted, I believe there are positive and lasting benefits we will take from this experience. Improving the health and safety of our school environment, empowering our teachers with new skills and resources to showcase their creativity, cherishing relationships - especially with students, and strengthening personal characteristics of resilience, adaptability, and independence are a few that come to mind. 
> 
> While my time here is shorter than I had hoped for, I do hope that staff, students, families and this community felt from me that they are respected, valued, capable, loved and that they belong to a district that is caring and compassionate. I still believe that, “Education is the most powerful weapon you can use to change the world.” I have seen this happen here in the Snoqualmie Valley School District and I know it will continue to happen in years to follow.
> 
> I am sharing this decision now with the hope that the School Board will have as much time as possible to conduct a thorough and comprehensive search process to hire an exceptional superintendent that this amazing school district deserves. In the meantime, I look forward to completing this school year with the same passion and commitment that I have given over these past three years and throughout my career. You have my assurance that I will continue focus on what is best for our students, staff and families during these unprecedented times.
> 
> You have all taught me so much and I am honored to have served this district.
> 
> Respectfully,
> 
> Robert Manahan
