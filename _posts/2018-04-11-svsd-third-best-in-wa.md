Congratulations SVSD!!!

It is an incredible honor for our school district to be recognized as one of the top districts in Washington based upon a [nationwide survey by BackgroundChecks.org](https://backgroundchecks.org/top-school-districts-in-washington-2018.html), an organization focused on public safety, community involvement and education. The following contributed to their rankings: student performance (math and reading test scores), dropout rates, school funding, and area poverty rates. Data was collected from 9,577 school districts across the United States. 
What they said about the SVSD: "At #3 is Snoqualmie Valley School District, one of the largest districts in the state covering over 400 square miles in King County, WA. Academic achievement in the district continues to improve, with Snoqualmie Valley becoming the only district in the state to be named on the AP Honor Roll for six straight years from 2010 through 2015."

Thank you again voters for providing our District with the resources necessary to be one of the best in the State. Our kids are worth it!
