## 1. What property taxes help pay for schools? ##

About 55 percent of property tax revenues collected in King County help pay for schools. The "State School Fund" component of property taxes is $2.70 per $1000 of assessed value for the 2020 tax year. It partially pays for the state's program for basic education. The state legislature and governor write and sign the laws that set these tax rates. The "School" component of property taxes is $4.25 per $1000 of assessed value. It contains both Snoqualmie Valley School District levies and bonds. See more at [King County 2020 property taxes](https://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/assessor/2020Taxes.aspx).

## 2. Who decides to run local school levies and bonds? ##

The [Snoqualmie Valley School Board of Directors](https://www.svsd410.org/domain/57) decides to run levies and bonds and for how much. Each board member is elected to a four year term by voters residing within the Snoqualmie Valley School District.

Local School Levies
===================

## 3. What do local school levies pay for? ##

Levies are for learning. A levy is a short-term, local property tax passed by the voters of a school district that the district uses to fund programs and services that the state does not fund or fully fund as part of “basic education.” There are three types of levies:

* Capital levies fund modern technology, enhanced building security, and renovation projects. Capital levies can be approved for up to six years.
* Educational Programs and Services (EP&O) levies allow a school district to provide things like teachers, support staff, supplies and materials, or services that the state only partially funds. Funding provided by the state does not fully cover the actual costs to operate a school district, so enrichment levies bridge the gap in funding. Enrichment levies can be approved for up to four years.
* Transportation levies fund things like new buses or major repairs to older buses to prolong their life. Transportation levies can be approved for up to two years.

## 4. Don't my state taxes pay for this? ##

Funding for education in the state of Washington is complicated and can lead to questions about how schools receive the money needed to operate. The state of Washington is required to supply school districts with state funding for “basic education” which is based on what is referred to as a “prototypical model” representing the Legislature’s assumptions of what resources are required to provide the program of basic education.

Unfortunately, when the funding provided by the state does not cover the actual costs to operate, construct and maintain a school district, districts often utilize bonds and levies to bridge the gap. This local funding allows school districts to provide the structures and services communities rely on, which allows students to grow and thrive.

## 5. Why do I have to keep voting to retain levies? ##

Like a subscription, citizens must vote approve to renew school levies. The renewal of these levies is critical to allow the District to continue providing a high-quality education and to meet operational needs.

## 6. What local school levies does the Snoqualmie Valley School District renew? ##

SVSD typically renews a four-year Educational Programs and Operations (EP&O) levy and a four-year Technology Capital levy. Snoqualmie Valley voters most-recently approved the levies in 2018 and they will expire in 2022.

## 7. What does the EP&O levy pay for? ##

* School nurses, counselors, STREAM teachers, support staff
* Instructional coaches and training to improve teaching
* Special Education
* Educational programs
* Curriculum and supplies
* Substitutes
* Food services
* Pupil transportation
* Student activity programs (music, art, clubs, sports, extracurricular)
* Summer school
* Materials, insurance, utilities, other operational costs
* Locally-bargained compensation and supplemental work
* Community use of facilities
* Opening new high school (2019)
* Transitioning to 7-period HS schedule
* Reinstating third middle school (2019)

* Behavioral health services
* Reduce student fees for classes/labs, extracurricular, supply lists
* Increase school unit budgets
* Collective bargaining to attract and retain staff
* Staffing support to increase focus on student data collection and analysis

## 8. What does the technology levy pay for? ##

Technology levy funds pay for technical infrastructure that the State’s funding model does not cover. For example:
* Classroom technology resources—including mobile devices, multimedia presentation tools, web resources—that help students engage in learning, research, collaborate, create and share their work.
* Instructional training, equipment and materials to add more Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) educational opportunities throughout our schools (such as Robotics, Intro to Engineering, Project Lead the Way).
* On-going training for teachers on how to utilize classroom technologies, such as mobile devices, to maximize student learning, communication and accountability.
* Support for technology infrastructure including replacement of older computers, printers, phones and copiers.
* Enhanced communication tools, school safety systems and data management systems to improve operational efficiencies and empower teachers to use student assessment data effectively to help individualize instruction.

## 9. How many votes does it take to pass a levy?

All the levy measures must be approved by a simple majority (50% + 1) of voters.

## 10. What happens if the local school levies fail to pass? ##

SVSD has been fortunate to have the support of its community for many years. When surrounding districts have failed to pass levies, they typically address the budget shortfall by tapping into their emergency funds and eliminating staff until they can pass a levy. It is up to the school board to determine how a district responds to reduced revenues.

School Bonds
============

## 11. What do local school bonds pay for? ##

Bonds are for building. A bond provides funding for capital projects such as purchasing property for schools, constructing new schools, or modernizing existing schools. Bonds are sold to investors who are repaid with interest over time from property tax collections, generally between 10-25 years.

## 12. How many votes does it take to pass a bond?

All bond measures must be approved by a 60% super-majority of voters.
