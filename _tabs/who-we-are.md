Snoqualmie Valley Citizens for Schools is a non-profit 501(c)4 social welfare group. We are comprised entirely of volunteer parents and community members.

SVCS has been advocating for levy and bond campaigns supporting the Snoqualmie Valley School District since 2014. SVCS has successfully campaigned for four levies and a bond. We would love for you to [join us](/volunteer).
